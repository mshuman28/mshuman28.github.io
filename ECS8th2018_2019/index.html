        <h4>Hello! This is my folder for CSS during this school year.</h4>
		<h3><strong>Something I Learned</strong></h3>
		<p>In class I learned how to code HTML, how computer work, and what they are made of. I also learned a couple of cool math/computer science skills.
		<h3><strong>Advice To Future Students</strong></h3>
		<p>My advice to future is that this is a challenging class, work hard and don't get fooled by the name of this course.
